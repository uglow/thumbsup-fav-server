See the [contribution guidelines][contributing] if you'd like to contribute to this project.

## Prerequisite Software

Before you can build and test this project, you must install and configure the
following products on your development machine:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com) and/or the **GitHub app** (for [Mac](http://mac.github.com) or
  [Windows](http://windows.github.com)); [GitHub's Guide to Installing Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) is a good source of information.
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), (version specified in the engines field of [`package.json`](package.json)) which is used to run tests.

## Project organisation

The project is organised into the following folder structure:

- `/` - Project-level configuration (linting rules, CI, docs, license)
- `.github/` - Github workflow
- `docs/` - Theme documentation (not used yet)
- `example/` - A complete example to demonstrate this software
- `patch/` - Patches that are applied to the Docker image
- `src/` - The source code and test specifications

## Installing

```shell
# Install the dependencies & devDependencies
npm install
```

## Running Tests

```shell
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run unit tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests and see the coverage report
npm run test:report
```

## Formatting your source code

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the source code.
If the source code is not properly formatted, the CI will fail and the PR cannot be merged.

You can automatically format your code by running:

- `npm run lint`: format _all_ source code

A better way is to set up your IDE to format the changed file on each file save.

### WebStorm / IntelliJ

1. Open `Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript > Prettier`
1. Find the field named "Prettier Package"
1. Add `<PATH_TO_YOUR_WORKSPACE>/<project-root>/node_modules/prettier`

## Linting/Verifying your Source Code

You can check that your code is properly formatted and adheres to coding style:

```shell
# Check that the code is formatted and following the coding style:
npm run verify

# Fix any auto-fixable errors
npm run lint
```

## Semantic Release Setup

This section is include for informational purposes only.

This repo uses [semantic-release][semantic-release] to manage software versions and packaging.
**There is a one-time setup-step required - WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE**, which creates a GitHub
personal access token, an NPM token, and connects them to Travis CI.

One time setup:
```shell script
cd <to repo folder>
npx semantic-release-cli setup

? What is your npm registry? https://registry.npmjs.org/
? What is your npm username? u_glow
? What is your npm password? [hidden]
? What is your NPM two-factor authentication code? [hidden - Authenticator app]
? Provide a GitHub Personal Access Token (create a token at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo) 
? What CI are you using? GitHub Actions (or choose "Other" and the tokens are displayed for you manually add)

```
